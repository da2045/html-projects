    <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
    <div>
</html>
        <p><b> Hypertext Markup Language <u>(HTML)</u></b> is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications.</p>
        <p>Web browsersreceive <u>HTML</u>, documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. <u>HTML</u> describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document</p>
        <p><u>HTML</u> elements are the building blocks of  pages. With <u>HTML</u> constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. <u>HTML</u>, provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. <u>HTML</u> elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as <span class = "redH">&#60;img/&#62;</span> and <span class="redH">&#60;input/&#62;</span> directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as <span class="redH">&#60;p&#62;</span> surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the <u>HTML</u> tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.</p>

    <h3>Markup</h3>
    <div>
        <p><u>HTMI</u>, markup consists of several key components, including those called tags (and their attributes), character-based data types, character references and entity references. <u>HTML</u>, tags most commonly come in pairs like <span class = "redH">&#60;h1&#62;</span> and <span class="redH">&#60;h1/&#62;</span>, although some represent empty elements and so are unpaired, for example <span class="redH">&#60;img/&#62;</span>. The first tag in such a pair is the start tag, and the second is the end tag (they are also called opening tags and closing tags).</p>
        <p>Another important component is the <u>HTML</u> document type declaration, which triggers standards mode rendering.</p>
        <p>The following is an example of the classic "Hello, World" program:</p>
    <pre class = "redH">&#60;!DOCTYPE html&#62;</pre>
    <pre class = "redH">&#60;html&#62;</pre>
        <pre class = "redH">&#60;head&#62;</pre>
            <pre class = "redH">&#60;title&#62;This is a title&#60;/title&#62;</pre>
        <pre class = "redH">&#60;head&#62;</pre>
        <pre class = "redH">&#60;body&#62;</pre>
            <pre class = "redH">&#60;p&#62; Hello world&#60;p&#62;</pre>
        <pre class = "redH">&#60;/body&#62;</pre>
    <pre class = "redH">&#60;/html&#62;</pre>
